## ``` To Do üõ† ``` 

- [ ] Clear out the confusion between `params.grad` and `params.grad.data`, raised a thread and after understanding gotta update in the Notion note. 
- [ ] Gotta finish the Chapter 4 by today, and create a Anki board for this chapter and load em all for future learning. And update the solution to previous confusion.
