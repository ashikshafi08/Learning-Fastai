# Learning-Fastai
This repo contains the notebooks and notes and certain study materials I am using to learn Fastai from scratch. This will be updated as I learn.

##  ``` Notion Link for the notes ✍🏻```
-  [Under the hood : Training a Digit Classifier](https://www.notion.so/Under-the-hood-Training-a-Digit-Classifier-8c84c3c8b556411b9381b7c1a7cd8d3e)



## ``` Projects 🤖 ``` 
This folder holds the projects that I have done using fastai while learning. More to come! 

 - [x] [Detect Covid 19 using X-RAYS](https://github.com/ashikshafi08/Learning-Fastai/blob/main/Projects/Detect_Covid19.ipynb) 
 
 
##  ``` Log 🎯` ```
Will update the daily log here, things like what changes have been made , new addition would be updated here. So yeah! Keep an eye over here 🧐

- **21 Jan 2021** Added the Project folder, which contains Detect Covid 19 with Chest XRays project. Notebook updated till Summarizing Gradient Descent, next would be applying the concept of gradient descent on *MNIST data* to derive the Loss Function. Even the Notion have been updated! 
- **25 Jan 2021** Didn't update the log for few days, will finish Chapter 4 soon by today. Went on crazy 5 hours study session, and awake from night! Now I was able to understand the foundations clearly. Spent quite alot of time on topics where weren't making sense, but after quite a struggle and spending more hours was able to understand better. Done till *Creating an Optimizer* using certain **fastai** classes was fun. Will finish this soon and edit this message too. 


## ``` To Do 🛠 ``` 

- [ ] Clear out the confusion between `params.grad` and `params.grad.data`, raised a thread and after understanding gotta update in the Notion note. 
- [ ] Gotta finish the Chapter 4 by today, and create a Anki board for this chapter and load em all for future learning. And update the solution to previous confusion.
