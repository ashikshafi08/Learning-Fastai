##  ``` Log üéØ` ```
Will update the daily log here, things like what changes have been made , new addition would be updated here. So yeah! Keep an eye over here üßê

- **21 Jan 2021** Added the Project folder, which contains Detect Covid 19 with Chest XRays project. Notebook updated till Summarizing Gradient Descent, next would be applying the concept of gradient descent on *MNIST data* to derive the Loss Function. Even the Notion have been updated! 
- **25 Jan 2021** Didn't update the log for few days, will finish Chapter 4 soon by today. Went on crazy 5 hours study session, and awake from night! Now I was able to understand the foundations clearly. Spent quite alot of time on topics where weren't making sense, but after quite a struggle and spending more hours was able to understand better. Done till *Creating an Optimizer* using certain **fastai** classes was fun. Will finish this soon and edit this message too. 
- **26 Jan 2021** Completed the whole Chapter 4, will work on the Anki board and the research project at this end of the Chapter lately. Oh yeah! still the confusion will be fixed soon lol
- **27 Jan 2021** Took up the assignment for working on the full `MNIST` dataset, was really fun and quite challenging on finding the loss function. But not really satisfied with the thing, have to find other's best and minimalistic method of doing this and replicate / learn from them. It was my first shot on solving this after completing the Chapter 4. More to go! Started with the Chapter 5 to lit the curiousity! Will refer regex lately and get done remaining works with the Anki and other left off works. **NOTION** has been  uploaded for Image Classification - chapter 5. 
- **10 Feb** Woah! Worked ass off for almost 6+ hours finished up the lecture, might take 2 days off to puzzle everything into Anki and solve the questionnaire on the book. Meanwhile work on competetions. Also check those notes. Plus added a Project for now, worked while learning fastai. Will clean and update soon.
- **12 Feb** Couldn't update the log yesterday was working full blow in Kaggle Competetions. Worked on 3 competetions so far, 2 came out really except one hopefully fix it asap. 
- **14 Feb** Started with a new chapter.
- **3 Jun** Starting again with Fastai, moved this log from the ReadMe to a seperate markdown. Gonna work on Questionnaire and Anki board today.
